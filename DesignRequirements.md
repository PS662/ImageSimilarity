**Image similarity backend for google lens like feature**

Develop an alternative to Google Lens by implementing image similarity search using multiple approaches.

**Methods for performing similarity search.**
- Feature extraction using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like ResNet, VGG, or EﬃcientNet, followed by nearest neighbor search (e.g., k-NN or cosine similarity).
- Deep metric learning approaches such as Siamese Networks or Triplet Loss-based models
- Visual embeddings generated via Vision Transformers (ViTs) or CLIP.
- Hashing-based methods such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) or deep learning-based hashing.
- Autoencoder-based image reconstruction to map images into a latent space for similarity comparison.


**Fine-tuning**
- Fine-tune the image dataset for each of the proposed approaches
- Compare the performance of each approach by evaluating metrics such as precision, recall, and retrieval accuracy for the similarity search task.
- Consider computational eﬃciency and scalability for real-time usage scenarios.

**Deliverables**
- A detailed report comparing the results and performance of all methods.
- Insights into which method works best for speciﬁc use cases (e.g., speed vs accuracy, handling various image types, etc.)
